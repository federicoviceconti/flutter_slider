# flutter_slider

Creates simple flutter slides with a .json file, which adapts to every resolution

## Why?

This project is created for our flutter tech corner, which we explain flutter patterns for state management such as: BLoC or Provider.

To make this speech special, we show the power of provider flutter, making this presentation with Flutter.

# What is a tech corner?

Every widgets extends from BaseWidget, and every model extends the BaseNotifier.
The Api class contains the interaction with a mock server.

# Where can I find slides example?
